               <ul>
               Currently undertaking RIBA part II studies at UCL Bartlett, in unit 21 under Abigail Ashton, Andrew Porter and Tom Holberton. 

               This year's brief is set in Marseilles - the gateway to the mediterranean from europe. Starting with Jean Claude-Izzo's 'Total Kheops' and now looking at modern governance, I have now begun designing my first postgrad design project.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                Before this, I studied at university of nottingham for undergraduate RIBA part I - and graduated with a first class honours in BArch Architecture.
