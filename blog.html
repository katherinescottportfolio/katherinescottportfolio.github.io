            Hello there

        I thought it would be a bit of fun to start my own website - so here I am! 

        This week I am working towards my first crit at the Bartlett, having had my first pin up a couple of weeks ago. I have stumbled across a rather brilliant Cedric Price project which is similar to the project I am working on - of creating  a new form of governance building in Marseille. 

        This project by Cedric price is called 'Pop-up Parliament' and I went to the British Library to sift through the 1965 volume of bound New Society magazines to find it.

        Here is the premise:

        <ol> to knock down parliament's existing buildings in london and build a pop up parliament building - see picture below 
        </ol>

        <img src="./work/03.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:250px;height:375px" >

<ol>        and this building would then offer a new flexible, more democratic architecture to enable a more transparent governance. 

        This has been a great help for formulating my own programme - so time will tell what spaces my own design will hold!

        Kx </ol>

                </ul>
